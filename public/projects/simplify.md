For most of 2024, I was working on Epic's
[Simplify](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/epic1979_as-part-of-our-commitment-to-accessibility-activity-7242510244650606593-492F)
project on two fronts:

- I was a member of the **framework** team, where I was responsible for
  integrating the project with controls that are ubiquitous in our software,
  and helping to define APIs used by several teams.
- At the same time, I used those APIs to implement the project's functionality
  at one higher level of abstraction.

Since then, I've gone on a trip to shadow end users, and I remain my
workgroup's point-person for Simplify-related work.
