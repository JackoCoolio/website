After an internship during the summer of 2022, I was offered a full-time
Software Developer position on the same team I interned with.

Developers at Epic are directly responsible for bringing their projects from an
idea to reality, so I wear several hats:

#### Researcher
- Leading meetings with customer leadership to learn about the problems they and
  their users face.
- Shadowing end-users to identify *which problems* need solving.

#### Designer
- Creating innovative solutions to make healthcare workers' jobs easier.
- Working closely with UX designers and AX reps to make our software intuitive
  and accessible.

#### Developer
- Navigating and modernizing a monolithic legacy codebase.
- Solving technical problems with *TypeScript* and *C#*.
