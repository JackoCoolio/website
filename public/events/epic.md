After an internship during the summer of 2022, I was offered a full-time
Software Developer position on the same team I interned with.

I was directly responsible for bringing my projects from an idea to reality, so
I wore several hats:

#### **Researcher**
- Lead meetings with customer leadership to learn about the problems they and
  their users face.
- Shadow end-users to identify *which problems* need solving.

#### **Designer**
- Create innovative solutions to make healthcare workers' jobs easier.
- Work closely with UX designers and AX reps to make software intuitive and
  accessible.

#### **Developer**
- Navigate and modernize a monolithic legacy codebase.
- Solve technical problems with *TypeScript* and *C#*.
