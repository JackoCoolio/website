I took a bunch of AP classes in high school, so I was able to graduate in three
years, rather than four. I received a B.S. in Computer Sciences and a
Certificate (minor) in Mathematics.

A few of my favorite classes:

- COMP SCI 537: Operating Systems with Yuvraj Patel
- GEOSCI 110: Evolution and Extinction with Shanan Peters
- COMP SCI 640: Introduction to Computer Networks
